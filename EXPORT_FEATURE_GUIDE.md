# Export Feature Implementation Guide

## Overview
I've successfully implemented a comprehensive data export feature for your expense tracker app that allows users to export their transaction data as CSV or Excel files.

## Backend Implementation

### New API Endpoints
1. **CSV Export**: `GET /api/transactions/export/csv`
2. **Excel Export**: `GET /api/transactions/export/excel` 
3. **Summary Stats**: `GET /api/transactions/summary`

### Query Parameters (All Endpoints)
- `startDate`: Filter transactions from this date (ISO 8601 format)
- `endDate`: Filter transactions until this date (ISO 8601 format)
- `category`: Filter by specific category (or "all" for no filter)
- `type`: Filter by "income", "expense", or "all"

### Example API Calls
```bash
# Export all transactions as CSV
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  "http://192.168.0.119:3000/api/transactions/export/csv"

# Export filtered data as Excel
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  "http://192.168.0.119:3000/api/transactions/export/excel?startDate=2024-01-01&category=Food"

# Get summary statistics
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  "http://192.168.0.119:3000/api/transactions/summary?type=expense"
```

## iOS Frontend Implementation

### New Components
1. **ExportDataSheet.swift**: Main export interface
2. **Updated TransactionsAPI.swift**: Added export methods
3. **Export buttons**: Added to RecentView and ReportsView

### How Users Access Export Feature
- **Recent View**: Tap the export button (↗️) in the top-left corner
- **Reports View**: Tap the export button (↗️) in the top-left corner

### Export Interface Features
1. **Format Selection**: Choose between CSV and Excel
2. **Filtering Options**:
   - Transaction type (All, Income, Expense)
   - Category selection
   - Custom date range toggle
3. **Live Preview**: Shows summary statistics of data to be exported
4. **File Sharing**: Uses iOS share sheet to save or share files

### Export Process Flow
1. User taps export button
2. ExportDataSheet opens with filtering options
3. User selects format (CSV/Excel) and applies filters
4. Preview shows summary of data to be exported
5. User taps "Export" button
6. App downloads data from backend
7. File is saved temporarily and iOS share sheet opens
8. User can save to Files app, share via email, etc.

## File Formats

### CSV Format
- Headers: Transaction ID, Type, Amount, Category, Note, Date, Created At, Updated At
- Compatible with Excel, Google Sheets, Numbers
- Human-readable text format

### Excel Format (.xlsx)
- Same data as CSV but in native Excel format
- Auto-sized columns for better readability
- Professional formatting
- Works with Excel, Numbers, Google Sheets

## Technical Details

### Backend Dependencies Added
- `csv-writer`: For CSV file generation
- `xlsx`: For Excel file generation

### iOS Features Used
- `URLSession`: For API communication
- `UIActivityViewController`: For file sharing
- `UniformTypeIdentifiers`: For proper file type handling
- SwiftUI sheets and navigation

### Security
- All exports require user authentication
- Users can only export their own transactions
- Temporary files are cleaned up after sharing
- No sensitive data logged

## Testing the Feature

### Backend Testing
```bash
cd /Users/korbinhillan/Desktop/expense-backend/expense-tracker
npm test  # Runs export service tests
npm start # Start the server
```

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Start the backend server
2. Open the iOS app and log in
3. Add some test transactions
4. Go to Recent or Reports view
5. Tap the export button (↗️)
6. Try different export formats and filters
7. Verify files can be opened in Excel/Numbers

### Test Cases Included
- CSV file generation with correct headers and data
- Excel file generation and format validation
- Summary statistics calculation
- Empty data handling
- Data filtering and date range functionality

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Export button not visible**: Make sure you're logged in and on Recent/Reports view
2. **Export fails**: Check network connection and backend server status
3. **File won't open**: Ensure the receiving app supports the file format
4. **No data in export**: Check if filters are excluding all transactions

### Error Messages
- "Export failed: Network request failed" - Backend server issue
- "Failed to load summary" - API connection problem
- "No transactions found" - All data filtered out or no transactions exist

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements you could add:
1. **PDF Reports**: Generate formatted PDF reports with charts
2. **Email Integration**: Direct email sending with attachments
3. **Scheduled Exports**: Automatic monthly/weekly exports
4. **Cloud Storage**: Direct save to Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.
5. **Custom Templates**: User-defined export formats
6. **Bulk Operations**: Export multiple date ranges at once

## File Structure

### New Files Created
```
Backend:
└── src/services/exportService.ts
└── src/__tests__/export.test.ts

iOS:
└── Sheets/ExportDataSheet.swift
```

### Modified Files
```
Backend:
└── src/routes/transactions.ts (added export endpoints)
└── package.json (added dependencies)

iOS:
└── API/TransactionsAPI.swift (added export methods)
└── Views/Recent/RecentView.swift (added export button)
└── Views/Reports/ReportsView.swift (added export button)
```

## Support
The export feature is now fully functional and ready for use. Users can export their transaction data in multiple formats with flexible filtering options, making it easy to analyze their financial data in external applications.
